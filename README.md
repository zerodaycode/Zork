# üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

`Zork++` was born as a need for build `C++` projects with the *modules* feature, introduced in the `C++20` standard.

Due to a the limitations present in the already existent build systems and the difficult of use modules consistently in the first years after being released as a language feature,
we started to design a tool that, just take some `C++` files, generates the necessary command lines and invoke the compiler and produces the desired executable/library!

# üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

## - Installing

Easiest way of start with `Zork++` is to download the [latest release
available](https://github.com/zerodaycode/Zork/releases) for your current operating system. After that, `Zork++` will be ready to use on your system.

## - Availability

`Zork++` is available under:

- Linux (tested on Arch and Debian systems)
- Windows (there's some limitations)
- MacOS (still not complete support)

## -  Prerequisites

In order to work with `Zork++`, you will need a `C++` toolchain and a compiler in your system.

- Clang
- GNU GCC
- Microsoft MSVC

Currently `Zork++` it's only working with `LLVM's Clang`, but is ready to implement the other two major compilers. See please the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're ready to help us!

> NOTE: If you are using Windows, you will need to install Clang via `Msys2`. See [Windows special requeriments](#windows_special_requeriments) entry for more info

## - Generating a new C++ project

You can use Zork with an already existing project, or start a new one from a terminal.

- Choose an empty folder to start with a fresh start.
- Assuming, you have `Zork++` in your path (installers should have done already for you), type:

`$ zork++ new calculator --compiler clang`

After a moment, a new project should be created in your desired directory.
And a output should have appeared in your terminal.

```
[SUCCESS]: Compilation job finished. Total time spent on the process: 332 ms

Hello from an autogenerated Zork project!
RESULT '+': 10
RESULT '-': 6
RESULT '*': 16
RESULT '/': 1
```

What happened here?

- We are calling the `Zork` executable previouslly installed on the system
- With the new argument, we are instructing `Zork` to autogenerate a new `C++` project where the standard is `C++20`, an it's built based on *modules*. That project contains a predeterminated structure as follows

<p align="center">
  <a href="" rel="noopener">
 <img width=250px height=300px src="./assets/autogenerated_project_structure.png" alt="Zork++ Logo"></a>
</p>

We created a folder `examples`. Then, we run the command line above to create the new project `calculator`. Zork autogenerates an structure where:

- `dependencies` => Empty folder. Usually we're you should put your third-party or external libraries, headers...
- `ifc` => stands for *interfaces*. We putted here the *module interface units* of the project.
- `src` => where the *module implementation files* lives.
- `tests` => where the *unit tests* and the *integration tests* of your new project are.
- `main.cpp` => The classical entry point for a `cpp` program.
- `zork.conf` => Finally! We arrived at the most important thing as a client that you will need to understand when working with `Zork++`.
See the [The zork.conf config file](#zork_conf) section to have a deep understand on how to write the configuration file and your project.

> Note that this is just a guideline. You may prefer to organize your files in another complete different way. We are just providing a predefined standard to quickly start to work with.

Let's explore a little bit the `out` directory. Here is where your compiler it's putting all the elements after the compilation and linkage process. It may contain a binary, a library... Also, contains the intermediate files needed for create the final executable of library.

- `modules` => it's a generated folder by `Zork` where puts all the precompiled module interfaces. Also, is where stores the object files for the `cpp` source files.
- `zork/intrinsics` => this is a special one. Sometimes `Zork` needs something extra to work correctly. So this is the place where lives those neccesary things. See [Windows special requeriments](#windows_special_requeriments) for more info.
- `calculator.exe` => We arrive! This is the final binary generated for the project.

# üîß The Zork's `zork.conf` config file <a name="usage"></a>

Wow! We finally arrive at the most important part of `Zork++`. The `zork.conf` configuration file is the core of the project. This is where you construct the set-up of your project, instructing `Zork++` to behave as you expect. We are going to take the `zork.conf` from the example of the last point, but first, let's be clear with the semantics of the file.

- `[[#attribute]]` => This is an attribute. An attribute within `Zork++` is like a major region where you will configure certain aspects related with the attribute's name.
- `property: value` => A property always belongs to an attribute. This is where you specify a concrete value for some option available for an attribute.

> The conjunction of an `[[#attribute]]` with its declared `properties` is known as a section.

Here is the configuration file for the example above:

```
# This file it's autogenerated as an example of a Zork config file

[[#project]]
name: calculator
authors: Zero Day Code  # Replace this for the real authors

[[#compiler]]
cpp_compiler: clang++

[[#language]]
cpp_standard: 20
std_lib: libc++
modules: true

[[#build]]
output_dir: ./out

[[#executable]]
executable_name: calculator
sources: *.cpp
auto_execute: true

[[#modules]]
base_ifcs_dir: calculator/ifc/
interfaces: *.cppm
base_impls_dir: calculator/src/
implementations: 
    math.cpp
    math2.cpp=[math]
```

As you see, there is a total of 6 sections. Every section starts always with an `[[#attribute]]` and is followed by its properties.

> Look at the `*.file_ext` syntax. This is called *wildcard syntax*. Wildcard syntax will allows you to specify every file in the relative path of that wildcard that has the same extension, avoiding you to write every `.file_ext` file present in that path.

```
*.cpp             // Takes every .cpp file in the root of the project.
./sources/*.cpp   // Takes every .cpp file in the ./sources folder

// [Alternate syntaxes]

// You can specify any infinite number of directories comma separated
sources: *.cpp, ./sources/*.cpp

// or by a new line preceded by a tab indentation
sources: 
    *.cpp
    ./sources/*.cpp
```

> Note that, if either an `[[#attribute]]` or a `property` isn't one of the available ones inside `Zork++`, program will refuse to run raising an error.

> For a full reference of every property available under a concrete section, please see the [zork.conf](#zork_conf_reference) reference guide.

Let's discusse briefly every section, to get a general perspective of what we are building.

- `[[#project]]` => Here you specify the metadata for the project. The `name` property is an important one, because some parsing is sometimes make it based on this parameter. Take care.

- `[[#language]]` => The configuration for the `C++` compiler options. From the desired language level, to the `std` library vendor dependant that you want to use, to the explicit declaration of use modules (not required, some properties are optional, see the referece for more info.)

- `[[#build]]` => The compiler output files, also with some internal ones needed by Zork. Here you specify where you want to create that directory.

- `[[#executable]]` => Whenever `Zork++` see this attribute, knows that we must produce an executable. You must specify the name of the executable, the sources that conforms it and you may optionally specify if you want to automatically runs the project after the compilation finishes.

- `[[#modules]]` => The core section for instruct the compiler to work with `C++20 modules`. Most important are the base path to the *interfaces* and *implementation* files (usually you don't want to spread your files elsewhere), so `Zork++` knows where it should looks for them, and the `interfaces` and `implementation` files where you speficy exactly what modules are composing your project.

## Additional notes on the `[[#modules]]` properties syntax

> Whenever you declare a module interface or a module implementation in the configuration file, you must take in consideration that sometimes modules (both interfaces or implementations) depends on another modules. Dependencies of one module on one or more modules are declared like below:

```
implementations: 
    math.cpp  // Implicitly depends on `math` interface

    math2.cpp=[math]  // Explicitly declares that depends on the `math` interface
```

> If the relation has no declared dependencies,
(meaning that only the file name of the module implementation
is declared here),
`Zork++` will assume that the unique interface that the module implementation depends has the same
name of the module interface unit.

The last one is not true for the *module interface units*. They may take any number of other module dependencies as they wish, but there's no direct mapping on the no dependency declaration, because is an interface unit.

Take care that the *module implementation unit* always depends, at least, on an interface unit, that's why `Zork++` assumes that, if the implementation unit does not explicitly declares a interface unit at least, a interface unit exists with the same name (without file extension) in the interfaces directory.

If the user does not use the same file name for both
the interface and the declaration, and not direct dependency is declared, a compiler error will be throwed because `Zork++` does not care about wrong
specified dependencies.

An alternate syntax exists for declare module and module dependencies (both for interfaces and implementation units)
```
implementations: math.cpp; math2.cpp=[math]
```

This allows you to declare every file that you desire in a unique line (something could prefer it), but it must be `;` separated in order to work.

> This one is the initial `Zork++` syntax for declaring source files dependencies, is considered the legacy way, and we reserve ourselves the
right of removing them from the application without previous warning.

where, the constant values declared for some *values* properties are:

> Note that in the *values* properties that are declared as a Python's array, we're not expecting to you to declare an array. We are expecting
one of the `allowed properties` declared within that array.

# üíª Windows special requeriments <a name="windows_special_requeriments"></a>

> If you are using Windows, you will need to install Clang via [Msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) in order to make it work with GCC's STD. Due to we are still not supporting the Microsoft tools directly, unique way is to link against GCC `(target=x86_64-windows-gnu-pc)`

> Due to the above explained issue, `Zork++` is specting that you have installed your `msys2` system in the root of your `C:` hard drive.
Potencially, we will upgrade this restriction to a better dynamic way of found the required things on Windows, but for now, isn't a priority for the dev team, because we're only supporting `Clang` for now, and `Clang` isn't self-sufficient on Windows (depends either on `GCC` or `MSVC` tools).

Also, there are troubles mapping standard library headers to module units, due to redefinition conflicts, so not everything works always in a smooth way under Windows.

Even tho, if you are using the `import std` feature, you should not have any problem building up your project.

# üìë C++23 `import std;` feature <a name="import_std"></a>

The `C++23` standard is suppose that is comming with a nice feature to finally, support modules in a real way, that is `import std;` statement.

This means that you will never have to `#include <header_name>` in your project to have access to some standard library utility. Also, there's a syntax in some compilers like `import <iostream>;` (any compiler offers its own alternate way of doing this) in order to be able to use the standard library headers as a module unit.

In `Zork++`, you have this feature enabled for any OS supported and even using `C++20` if you're working with `Clang` (remeber, it's the unique compiler support that we are offering now at the writting time), because the `modulemap` feature of `Clang`, that translates system headers into modules. So, in your project, you're able to:

- `import std;`  // preferred way, in line with C++23 feature
- `import <system_header_name>;` // individually import into your module some specific system header as a module.

> Note: last one syntax only works under Linux environments (potentially MacOS too). Under Windows, you only will be able to use `import std;` because `Zork++` manually implements an specific module map file to bring you support for the most important system headers. This is a temporally workaround (that's what we are expecting) and in future releases this will work uniformly for any OS.

## TODO doc for future contributors
Add notes about how to use the system. This is a todo-ed entry.
Keep in mind that we may take a few days to deploy this guide.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Running the tests

We distinguish two kind of tests in Zork:

### Unit tests

- This one tests directly different parts of the internal work of Zork, trying to make a reliable system to work with.

### Integration tests

- Integration tests in Zork are focused on build different kind of `C++` projects, and those under different operating systems.

All tests are running in different workflows that you can [check out here](
    https://github.com/zerodaycode/Zork/actions
). But, also, you can always donwload the source code and run them in a local environment.

- This project it's largely inspired in the best `C++` build system
ever created, obviously, the great [CMake](https://cmake.org/). We are users
of `CMake`, and we will be in the future. Zork just aims to provide a more user-friendly ecosystem of playing
